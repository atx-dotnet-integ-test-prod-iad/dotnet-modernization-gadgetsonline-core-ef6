# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Check the output for any warnings that, while non-breaking, may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns worth addressing.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to an appropriate and supported version of .NET, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Refer to the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) to ensure you are targeting an actively supported version.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally to verify runtime behavior:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application's key functionality to confirm that behavior matches the original legacy project.

### 5. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to validate correctness:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review any failing tests and determine whether they indicate regressions introduced during the transformation or pre-existing issues.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the codebase for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` dependencies, which are not available in cross-platform .NET
- `HttpContext` and related ASP.NET types, which may have moved to `Microsoft.AspNetCore`
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry, WMI, or certain `System.Drawing` features
- Configuration APIs that previously relied on `Web.config` or `App.config`

### 7. Verify Static Assets and Configuration Files

Confirm that files such as `appsettings.json`, static web assets, and any view or template files have been correctly carried over and are functioning as expected at runtime.

### 8. Publish the Application

Once local validation is complete, publish the application to verify the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to ensure all required files are present before deploying to the target environment.
