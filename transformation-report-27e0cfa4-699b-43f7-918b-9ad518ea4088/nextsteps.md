# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected in any of the projects within the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Confirm that the output reports zero errors and review any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and verify that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to an appropriate and supported version of .NET, such as `net8.0`. Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

If it is targeting an older or unsupported framework moniker, update it accordingly and re-run the build.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally to verify runtime behavior:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application and confirm that core functionality behaves as expected compared to the legacy version.

### 5. Execute Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, run them to validate business logic and integration points:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review the test results and address any failing tests that may indicate behavioral regressions introduced during the migration.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the codebase for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` dependencies, which are not available in cross-platform .NET
- `HttpContext` and related ASP.NET pipeline APIs if this is a web project
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry, WMI, or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
- Any third-party libraries that may still target .NET Framework only

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat` tooling to assist with this review.

### 7. Verify Configuration Files

Confirm that configuration has been properly migrated from `Web.config` or `App.config` to the appropriate `appsettings.json` format and that the application reads configuration correctly at runtime using `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`.

### 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application to confirm the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to ensure all required files, assets, and dependencies are present before deploying to the target environment.
