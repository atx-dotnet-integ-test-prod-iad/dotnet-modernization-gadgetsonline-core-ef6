# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected in any of the projects within the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Confirm that the output reports zero errors and review any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and verify that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

If the project is a web application, confirm that the appropriate SDK is declared at the top of the project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
```

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally and verify it runs without runtime errors:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application's primary workflows to confirm expected behavior.

### 5. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to validate that existing functionality has not regressed:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review the test results and investigate any failures.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the codebase for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` namespace usage, which is not available in cross-platform .NET
- `HttpContext` and related types, which should now come from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http`
- `ConfigurationManager`, which should be replaced with `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry or certain `System.Drawing` methods

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify any remaining platform-specific dependencies.

### 7. Verify Configuration Files

Confirm that `web.config` or `app.config` settings have been migrated appropriately to `appsettings.json` and that the application reads configuration correctly at runtime using `IConfiguration`.

### 8. Test on Target Platform

If the goal is cross-platform support, run the application on the intended non-Windows operating system (Linux or macOS) to surface any remaining platform-specific issues:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

### 9. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application to confirm the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory and verify that all required assets, static files, and dependencies are present before deploying to the target environment.
