# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to nullable reference types, deprecated APIs, or target framework compatibility.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to a supported and intended version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Refer to the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) to ensure you are targeting an actively supported version.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application using the .NET CLI to verify it runs as expected:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application and exercise its core functionality to check for any runtime errors that would not have been caught at build time.

### 5. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to validate that existing behavior has been preserved after the transformation:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review the test results and investigate any failures, as they may indicate behavioral regressions introduced during the migration.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the code for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` dependencies, which are not available in cross-platform .NET
- `HttpContext` and related ASP.NET types if this is a web project
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry, WCF, or `System.Drawing` (without a compatible replacement)
- Any third-party libraries that may have been targeting .NET Framework exclusively

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat` tooling to identify any remaining compatibility concerns.

### 7. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to surface any platform-specific issues that may not appear on a single OS.

### 8. Review Configuration Files

Ensure that configuration files such as `appsettings.json` (or equivalent) are correctly structured for the new hosting model. If the project previously used `Web.config` or `App.config`, verify that settings have been migrated appropriately to the new configuration system.
